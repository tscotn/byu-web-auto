# BYUradio Web Automated
This program takes slugs as user input and finds the corresponding setup sheet in a folder
then it retrieves headlines, guest info and the intro and outputs it for x number of slugs to a txt document
this makes it extremely quick to put info into the web

functionality to add:
retrieve from BOX -- (program can only function when box drive is downloaded...I could hypothetically make
make .txt upload straight to the web
 ^gotta open byuradio.com/admin and navigate to the episode of that day, open it, input everything into the text, save and close
 ^ this is a little too much for me at the moment

the txt document should ALWAYS be reviewed for accuracy
